# Git Exercises

Howdy!  I am a simple repo without much in it.  Let's walk through a couple of exercises.

## Clone me

First create a nice clone of this repo on your computer. 

## Fork me

Create your own fork.  This will generate a copy of me and put it on your account.

## Branches

1. First, create a branch called `first_branch`
2. Use ```git status``` to make sure you are on the branch
3. Now that you are on the branch create a text file with your favorite quote in it
4. Add and commit the file
5. Use the explicit push command (not just git push)

## It Broke!

1. Now go to your fork of the repo and get the clone url
2. Add a new remote called `my_fork`.  This will add a brand new remote for you to use.  By default clone creates origin
3. Push the branch to the fork

## Popping off commits

1. Add your name to the names.txt file
2. Add and commit but DO NOT PUSH
3. Now remove the last commit and change the name to your github username
4. Go ahead and add, commit and push

## Merge
1. Go back to the master branch
2. Merge the `my_first` branch into master
3. Push up the changes to origin

## Rejected!
1. Pull the change from the server.
2. If you get a conflict fix it
3. Then push up your changes to the origin
